Wang et al. propose the active learning through density clustering algorithm with three new features. We design a new importance measure to select representative instances deterministically. We employ tri-partition to determine the action to be taken on each instance. The new algorithm generally outperforms state-of-the-art active learning algorithms. The new algorithm requires only O(n) of space and O (mn2) of time.
